<h2>Price Issues:</h2>
<p>Price are collected from amazon website and then converted to the bangladeshi  tk format manually. This may affect the price section when the value of dollar increase or decrase with respect to taka.</p>

<h2>Service charge Issues:</h2>
<p>Price section is the direct price of amazon websites. But when you have to import the product shiping cost is needed. So the service charge may vary on shiping cost.</p>
